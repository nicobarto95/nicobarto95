## 💡 About Me

I design and maintain **cloud-native platforms** that empower development teams while keeping costs under control. My approach blends **Platform Engineering** principles with **FinOps** strategies and **SRE best practices** to deliver infrastructure that's both developer-friendly and business-smart.
```yaml
philosophy:
  - "Automate everything that can be automated"
  - "Security and cost optimization are features, not afterthoughts"
  - "Infrastructure should be invisible to developers"
  - "Observability drives reliability"
```
